-   0.4.0:
    -   Snapshots! The following commands now manage a single, easy-to-use snapshot for quickly managing state.
        -   `emu save <vm>` will save your VM's current state
        -   `emu load <vm>` will load the saved state (as many times as you want)
        -   `emu clear-state <vm>` will clear the saved state.
        -   Notes:
            -   Lots of operations in a rush seem to crash qemu easily. Still looking into this.
            -   You must clear a saved state before creating a new one. Saving twice results in an error. May change this.
    -   `emu clone` now has a cool progress meter for copying large files
        -   Also, you can now pass `-c` to copy the configuration as well as the image data. Default is off.
    -   Underpinnings now include a semi-comprehensive QMP client for qemu.
-   0.3.0:
    -   `emu shutdown` now waits for qemu to quit before quitting itself.
        -   Provide the `-n` flag to return to the shell instead of waiting.
    -   Allow `emu ssh` to supply arguments to the underlying `ssh` command.
    -   Code rewrite: most code has been replaced and re-organized for future enhancements including polymorphism amongst operating systems and hypervisors.
-   0.2.0:
    -   `emu list-disks` to list disks for a VM.
    -   `emu import` always creates a new disk when importing.
    -   `emu clone` copies all images from one VM to the new destination.
    -   `emu delete` now takes an optional parameter to delete individual VM images.
    -   `emu config copy` allows you to copy pre-configured settings from one VM to another.
    -   `emu create -a` can now be used to add disks to an existing VM.
    -   Disks are now created stamped with the epoch seconds they were created at.
    -   `emu list -r` lists running VMs only.
    -   Rename command; rename vms you manage.
    -   Better error messages in some situations.
-   0.1.1:
    -   Tracking of run state; specialized for systemd or ad-hoc qemu runs
        -   Reflected in lists and also with a new command `is-active`
-   0.1.0:
    -   First release (after 4 years of sitting on the shelf)
